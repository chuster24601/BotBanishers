Formula One,"

Formula One, also known as F1 or Grand Prix racing, is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The ""formula"" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held on purpose-built circuits and public roads.

The results of each race are combined to determine two annual World Championships, one for drivers and one for constructors. Drivers must hold valid Super Licences, the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA. The races are required to be held on tracks graded 1 (formerly A), the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA. Most events are held in rural locations on purpose-built tracks, but several events take place on city streets.

Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. The cars underwent major changes in 2017, allowing wider front and rear wings, and wider tyres, resulting in cornering forces closing in on 6.5g and top speeds of up to approximately 375 km/h (235 mph). As of 2019 the hybrid engines are limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm and the cars are very dependent on electronics—although traction control and other driving aids have been banned since 2008—and on aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres.","Formula One (F1) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The championship is held annually, with races taking place all around the world. The sport is known for its high speeds, advanced technology, and skilled drivers. 

F1 cars are designed to be the fastest and most advanced racing machines in the world. They are powered by highly sophisticated engines that can reach speeds of over 220 mph. The cars are also equipped with advanced aerodynamics, which help them to generate downforce and maintain stability at high speeds. 

The F1 championship is contested by teams, each of which consists of two drivers. The drivers compete in a series of races, with points awarded for finishing positions. The team with the most points at the end of the season is crowned the World Constructors' Champion, while the driver with the most points is crowned the World Drivers' Champion. 

F1 has a rich history, with the first championship race taking place in 1950. Over the years, the sport has produced many legendary drivers, including Juan Manuel Fangio, Ayrton Senna, and Michael Schumacher. Today, F1 remains one of the most popular and prestigious motorsports in the world.",0

Genghis Khan,"

Genghis Khan (c. 1162 – August 18, 1227) was the founder and first Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous empire in history after his death. He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. After founding the Mongol Empire and being proclaimed ""Genghis Khan"", he launched the Mongol invasions that conquered most of Eurasia. Campaigns initiated in his lifetime include those against the Qara Khitai, Caucasus, and Khwarazmian, Western Xia and Jin dynasties. These campaigns were often accompanied by wholesale massacres of the civilian populations – especially in the Khwarazmian and Western Xia controlled lands. By the end of his life, the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China.

Genghis Khan was born as Temüjin in Delüün Boldog, near the mountain Burkhan Khaldun, in modern-day Mongolia. He was the son of a Mongol chieftain, and was orphaned by the time he was nine. After a series of tribal wars, he rose to become the leader of the Mongolian Plateau. He then united the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia and became the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire in 1206. Under his leadership, the Mongols conquered most of Eurasia by 1227. He also encouraged religious tolerance in the Mongol Empire, and created the first international postal system. He died in 1227 after defeating the Western Xia. He was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia.","Genghis Khan, born Temujin, was the founder and first emperor of the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous empire in history. He was born in 1162 in the region that is now Mongolia, and grew up in a nomadic lifestyle. After his father was poisoned, Temujin was forced to flee with his family and was eventually captured and enslaved. He escaped and began to build a following, eventually becoming the leader of the Mongol tribes. 

Under his leadership, the Mongol Empire expanded rapidly, conquering much of Asia and parts of Europe. Genghis Khan was known for his military tactics, which included using a highly organized army and incorporating conquered peoples into his own forces. He was also known for his religious tolerance and his promotion of trade and commerce.

The Dead Sea,"

The Dead Sea, also known as the Salt Sea, is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and the West Bank to the west. It is located in the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River. Its surface and shores are 430.5 metres (1,412 ft) below sea level, Earth's lowest elevation on land. The Dead Sea is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2%, it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which animals cannot flourish, hence its name.

The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts, and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilizers. People also use the salt and the minerals from the Dead Sea to create cosmetics and herbal sachets. The Dead Sea also has a strong religious significance, and it is a place of pilgrimage for Jews, Christians, and Muslims.

The Dead Sea is receding at an alarming rate. Multiple canals and pipelines were proposed to reduce its recession, which had begun causing many problems. The Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, carried out by Jordan, will provide water to neighboring countries, while the brine will be carried to the Dead Sea to help stabilize its water level.","The Dead Sea is a saltwater lake located in the Jordan Rift Valley, bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and Palestine to the west. It is the lowest point on Earth, with its surface and shores lying 430.5 meters (1,412 feet) below sea level. The Dead Sea is also one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, with a salinity level of around 34.2%, which is almost ten times saltier than the ocean. Due to its high salt content, no fish or other marine life can survive in the Dead Sea.

The Dead Sea has been a popular destination for tourists and health-seekers for thousands of years. Its mineral-rich mud and water are believed to have therapeutic properties, and the area is home to several spas and resorts that offer treatments and therapies based on the Dead Sea's natural resources.

The Order of Magnitude is a prestigious honor that recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to the advancement of knowledge in the STEM fields.","The term ""order of magnitude"" is used in mathematics, physics, and engineering to describe the relative size of a quantity or measurement. It refers to the scale of the number, rather than its exact value. For example, if one quantity is ten times larger than another, they differ by one order of magnitude. If one is one hundred times larger, they differ by two orders of magnitude, and so on.

The concept of order of magnitude is useful in many fields, including astronomy, where it is used to describe the size and distance of celestial objects, and in computer science, where it is used to describe the complexity of algorithms and data structures. It is also used in economics, where it is used to describe the size of economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) and national debt.

The term ""order of magnitude"" is often abbreviated as ""OOM"" or ""OOMs"" in scientific literature and discussions. It is an important concept for scientists and engineers to understand, as it allows them to quickly estimate the scale of a problem or solution without needing to know the exact values involved.",0
IUCN Red List,"

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, founded in 1964, is the world's most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of biological species. It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. With its strong scientific base, the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity. It provides information about range, population size, habitat and ecology, use and/or trade, threats, and conservation actions that will help inform necessary conservation decisions.

The IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. The aim is to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the public and policy makers, as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction.

Species are classified by the IUCN Red List into nine groups, set through criteria such as rate of decline, population size, area of geographic distribution, and degree of population and distribution fragmentation. The categories range from ""Least Concern"" to ""Extinct"". The IUCN also recognizes ""Data Deficient"" species, which lack enough data to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of their risk of extinction.

The IUCN Red List is a critical indicator of the health of the world’s biodiversity. Far more than a list of species and their status, it is a powerful tool to inform and catalyze action for biodiversity conservation and policy change, critical to protecting the natural resources we need to survive.","The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is a comprehensive inventory of the conservation status of plant and animal species around the world.

Snuff (tobacco),"

Snuff is a smokeless tobacco product that is made from ground or pulverized tobacco leaves. It is inhaled or ""snuffed"" into the nasal cavity, delivering a swift hit of nicotine and a lasting flavoured scent. Snuff has been a popular form of tobacco use for centuries, with its origins dating back to the 16th century in Europe. It is used in many countries around the world, including the United States, India, and China.

Snuff is available in a variety of forms, including dry, moist, and scented varieties. Dry snuff is the most common form and is usually sold in tins or pouches. Moist snuff is a paste-like substance that is packaged in a tub or tin and is usually flavored with menthol or other flavors. Scented snuff is a combination of dry and moist snuff and is often flavored with fruit or floral scents.

Snuff is typically used by placing a pinch between the lower lip and gum or by sniffing it into the nasal cavity. It is also sometimes used as a form of aromatherapy. The nicotine in snuff is absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose, providing a quick and intense hit of nicotine.

Snuff is considered to be a safer alternative to smoking, as it does not produce smoke or tar. However, it is still addictive and can cause health problems, such as gum disease, tooth decay, and mouth cancer. It is also associated with an increased risk of stroke and heart attack. Therefore, it is important to use snuff responsibly and in moderation.","Snuff is a type of finely ground tobacco that is inhaled through the nose. It has been used for centuries as a form of smokeless tobacco, and was particularly popular in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. Snuff is made by grinding tobacco leaves into a fine powder, which is then flavored with various herbs and spices. It is typically stored in small containers, and is taken by placing a small amount on the back of the hand or on a small spoon, and then sniffing it into the nostrils. 

Although snuff is often considered a safer alternative to smoking, it still carries health risks. The inhalation of tobacco powder can cause irritation of the nasal passages and sinuses, and can also lead to addiction. In addition, snuff contains nicotine, which is a highly addictive substance that can have a number of negative health effects. Despite these risks, snuff remains popular in certain parts of the world, particularly in Scandinavia and the United States.",0

Iron Age,"

The Iron Age is a period in human history that followed the Bronze Age. It is commonly defined as the period between the introduction of ferrous metallurgy and the beginning of the historical record. The Iron Age is the last principal period of the three-age system, preceded by the Stone Age and the Bronze Age. Its date and context vary depending on the geographical region.

The Iron Age began in most of Europe and the Near East after 1200 BC, with the earliest production of iron artifacts in Anatolia and the Caucasus. The transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age in these regions is characterized by the widespread use of iron or steel. The Iron Age in Europe is characterized by an elaboration of designs in weapons, implements, and utensils. The earliest known iron artifacts are nine small beads dated to 3200 BC, which were found in burials at Gerzeh, Lower Egypt. They have been identified as meteoric iron shaped by careful hammering.

Meteoric iron, a characteristic iron–nickel alloy, was used by various ancient peoples thousands of years before the Iron Age. Such iron, being in its native metallic state, required no smelting of ores. Smelted iron appears sporadically in the archeological record from the middle Bronze Age. While terrestrial iron is naturally abundant, its high melting point of 1,538 °C (2,800 °F) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC.

The Iron Age in the Ancient Near East began with the rise of the Assyrian Empire in the mid-10th century BC. Assyrian rulers introduced the use of iron weapons and iron tools to their empire. The widespread use of iron weapons by Assyrian armies revolutionized warfare and allowed them to expand their empire. The Iron Age in the ancient Near East and the Mediterranean began in the 8th century BC with the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.","The Iron Age is a period in human history that began around 1200 BCE and lasted until the emergence of the Roman Empire in the 1st century BCE. It is characterized by the widespread use of iron tools and weapons, which replaced the earlier use of bronze. The Iron Age is divided into three main periods: the Early Iron Age, the Middle Iron Age, and the Late Iron Age.

During the Early Iron Age, iron technology was still relatively new and was used primarily for tools and weapons. The Middle Iron Age saw the emergence of more complex societies and the development of new technologies, such as iron plows and iron-tipped arrows. The Late Iron Age saw the rise of powerful empires, such as the Assyrians and the Persians, and the spread of iron technology throughout the world.

The Iron Age was a time of significant cultural and social change, as well as technological advancement. It marked the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age, and paved the way for the development of modern civilization. Today, the Iron Age is studied by archaeologists, historians, and anthropologists to better understand the origins of human society and the evolution of technology.",0

Ablation zone,"

Ablation zone is a term used in glaciology to describe the area of a glacier where more snow and ice is lost than is gained. It is the area where the glacier melts faster than it accumulates new snow and ice, resulting in a net loss of mass. The ablation zone is typically located at the lower end of a glacier, where the temperature is warmer and the snow and ice are exposed to the sun's radiation. The ablation zone is also known as the zone of wastage or the zone of melting.

The ablation zone is an important part of the glacier system, as it is the area where the glacier loses mass. This mass loss can be due to melting, evaporation, sublimation, or calving. The ablation zone is also the area where the glacier's terminus is located, as the glacier retreats due to the loss of mass. The size of the ablation zone can vary depending on the climate and the type of glacier.

The ablation zone is also important for understanding the dynamics of a glacier. The rate of ablation can be used to calculate the glacier's mass balance, which is the difference between the amount of snow and ice gained and lost. The mass balance is an important indicator of the health of a glacier, as a negative mass balance can indicate that the glacier is retreating.

The ablation zone is also important for understanding the impacts of climate change on glaciers. As the climate warms, the ablation zone expands, resulting in an increased rate of mass loss. This can lead to a glacier retreating, which can have a number of impacts on the local environment. For example, retreating glaciers can cause changes in the local hydrology, as the glacier's meltwater is no longer available to the local ecosystem.","The ablation zone, also known as the zone of wastage, is a region of a glacier where the ice is melting faster than it is being replenished by snowfall. This zone is located at the lower end of the glacier and is characterized by a steep gradient and a rough, irregular surface. The ablation zone is an important component of the glacier system, as it is responsible for the loss of ice and the formation of meltwater streams and rivers.

The ablation zone is influenced by a number of factors, including temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. In general, warmer temperatures and increased solar radiation lead to increased melting, while higher levels of precipitation can help to replenish the glacier with new snow and ice. However, in recent years, climate change has caused many glaciers to shrink, with the ablation zone expanding further up the glacier and the accumulation zone (where snowfall exceeds melting) shrinking in size.

The ablation zone is an important area of study for glaciologists and climate scientists, as it provides valuable insights into the impacts of climate change on the world's glaciers and ice sheets. Understanding the dynamics of the ablation zone is crucial for predicting future changes in glacier size and meltwater runoff, which can have significant impacts on water resources, sea level rise, and other environmental factors.",0
Paul Nobuo Tatsuguchi,"

He was born in Seattle, Washington, to Japanese immigrant parents and grew up in California. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his medical degree in 1945. After completing his residency in general surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, he served in the United States Army Medical Corps in Japan during the Korean War.

In the late 1950s, Tatsuguchi began to develop the concept of laparoscopic surgery, which uses a small camera and instruments inserted through tiny incisions in the abdomen to perform surgery. He was the first to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a procedure to remove the gallbladder, in the United States in 1981. He also developed the Tatsuguchi technique, which is used to perform laparoscopic appendectomies.

Earthquake shaking table,"

An earthquake shaking table, also known as a seismic simulator, is a device used to simulate the effects of an earthquake on a structure. It is typically used to test the seismic performance of structures, such as bridges, buildings, and other civil engineering structures, to ensure they are designed to withstand the forces of an earthquake. The shaking table is usually a large, rectangular table that is driven by a motor to produce a shaking motion. The table is usually mounted on a base that is designed to absorb the vibration and reduce the amount of noise produced. The table is then loaded with a model of the structure to be tested, and the motor is activated to produce a shaking motion that simulates the effects of an earthquake. The model is then monitored to measure its response to the shaking motion, and the results are used to evaluate the seismic performance of the structure.","An earthquake shaking table is a device used to simulate the motion of an earthquake. It is used to test the response of structures to seismic events, and to study the effects of earthquakes on buildings, bridges, and other structures. The shaking table consists of a large platform that is mounted on hydraulic actuators. The platform can be programmed to simulate the motion of an earthquake, with different frequencies and amplitudes. The shaking table is used in earthquake engineering research, as well as in the testing and certification of earthquake-resistant structures.

The first earthquake shaking table was developed in Japan in the 1960s. Since then, shaking tables have become an important tool in earthquake engineering research.

Mixed-member proportional representation,"

Mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) is a voting system used in some countries that combines elements of proportional representation (PR) and plurality/majoritarian systems. It is a hybrid of the two, and is used to achieve a balance between a party's share of the vote and its share of the seats in a legislature. Under MMP, each voter casts two votes: one for a local constituency representative, and one for a political party. The local representative is elected by a plurality/majoritarian system, while the party vote is used to determine the overall composition of the legislature, with seats allocated to parties in proportion to their share of the party vote. This ensures that the overall composition of the legislature reflects the overall share of the vote, while still allowing for local representation. MMP is used in countries such as Germany, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales.","Mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) is a voting system used in many countries around the world. It is a hybrid system that combines elements of both proportional representation and first-past-the-post systems. MMP aims to provide a more proportional representation of political parties in the legislature, while also maintaining a direct link between voters and their local representatives.

Under MMP, voters cast two votes: one for a local representative in their constituency, and one for a political party. The number of seats a party receives in the legislature is determined by the proportion of votes it receives in the party vote. If a party wins more constituency seats than its proportion of the party vote would suggest, it is awarded additional seats to make up for the discrepancy.

MMP has been adopted in a number of countries, including Germany, New Zealand, and Scotland. Supporters of MMP argue that it provides a fairer representation of political parties in the legislature, while also ensuring that local representatives remain accountable to their constituents. However, critics argue that MMP can lead to a proliferation of small parties and make it difficult to form stable governments.",0

Katharina Schroth,"

Katharina Schroth (1894–1985) was a German physical therapist and inventor of the Schroth Method, a three-dimensional exercise therapy for the treatment of scoliosis. She developed the method in the 1920s, based on her own experience of living with scoliosis. Schroth's method has been used to treat scoliosis for over 90 years and is still used today.

Schroth was born in 1894 in Berlin, Germany. She was the daughter of a doctor and was raised in a medical family. She developed scoliosis at the age of 14 and was told by her father that she would never be able to lead a normal life. Despite this, she was determined to find a way to manage her condition.

In 1921, Schroth began to develop her own exercise therapy for scoliosis. She studied anatomy and kinesiology and developed a series of exercises that focused on correcting the posture of the spine. She also developed a system of braces and supports to help maintain the correct posture.

Schroth's method was initially met with skepticism from the medical community, but she was eventually able to prove its effectiveness. In the 1950s, she opened a clinic in Germany to treat scoliosis patients with her method. She also wrote several books on the subject and lectured extensively on the topic.

Schroth's method has been used to treat scoliosis for over 90 years and is still used today. It is considered one of the most effective treatments for scoliosis and has been used to treat thousands of patients. Schroth's legacy lives on in the form of the Schroth Method, which continues to be used to treat scoliosis around the world.","Katharina Schroth (22 February 1894 – 19 December 1985) was a German physical therapist and founder of the Schroth Method, a conservative exercise approach for the treatment of scoliosis. Born in Dresden, Germany, Schroth suffered from scoliosis herself and was inspired to develop a method to treat the condition after experiencing the limitations of traditional medical treatments. 

Schroth's method involves a combination of specific exercises, breathing techniques, and corrective postures designed to improve spinal alignment and reduce the curvature of the spine. The method has been widely recognized as an effective non-surgical treatment for scoliosis, and is still used today in clinics around the world.

Schroth founded the first clinic for the treatment of scoliosis in Germany in 1921, and later established the Katharina Schroth Clinic in Bad Sobernheim, which continues to operate today. She also trained numerous physical therapists in her method, and authored several books on the subject.

Schroth's contributions to the field of physical therapy have been widely recognized, and she was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit by the German government in 1976.

It is a promising approach to quantum computing due to the ease of manipulating photons and their ability to travel long distances without significant loss of information. 

LOQC is based on the principle of quantum entanglement, where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other. In LOQC, photons are entangled and used to perform quantum operations such as quantum gates and measurements. 

One of the key advantages of LOQC is its potential for scalability. Unlike other quantum computing models that require complex and expensive hardware, LOQC can be implemented using standard optical components such as beam splitters and phase shifters. This makes it easier to build larger and more complex quantum systems. 

However, LOQC also faces several challenges, such as the difficulty of creating and maintaining entangled photon pairs and the susceptibility to noise and decoherence. Despite these challenges, LOQC remains an active area of research and development, with the potential to revolutionize computing and communication in the future.",0
Strongly connected component,"

A strongly connected component (SCC) is a subgraph of a directed graph in which every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. In other words, it is a maximal subgraph in which there is a path from each vertex to every other vertex. The concept of strongly connected components is important in graph theory and network analysis. It is used to identify the strongly connected components of a graph, which are the maximal subgraphs in which there is a path from each vertex to every other vertex. The strongly connected components of a graph can be used to identify the most important parts of a graph, as well as to identify the most important paths between two vertices. They can also be used to identify the most important cycles in a graph.","In graph theory, a strongly connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a subgraph in which every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. More formally, an SCC is a maximal strongly connected subgraph of a directed graph. In other words, it is a subgraph that is as strongly connected as possible, meaning that there is a directed path from any vertex in the subgraph to any other vertex in the subgraph.

SCCs are important in many areas of computer science, including algorithms, complexity theory, and software engineering. They are used in a variety of applications, such as finding the strongly connected components of a program's control flow graph, identifying the components of a network that are most critical to its functioning, and analyzing the structure of social networks.

There are several algorithms for finding SCCs in a directed graph, including Tarjan's algorithm, Kosaraju's algorithm, and the path-based algorithm. These algorithms typically involve traversing the graph in a certain order and maintaining a stack or other data structure to keep track of the vertices that have been visited.

SCCs have many interesting properties, such as being closed under certain operations like union and intersection, and having a unique topological ordering. They are also closely related to other concepts in graph theory, such as strongly connected digraphs, directed acyclic graphs, and Eulerian graphs.",0

Investment function,"

The Investment Function is a concept in economics that describes the relationship between the amount of capital invested and the expected return on that investment. It is a key component of the economic theory of capital budgeting, which is the process of evaluating and selecting potential investments. The Investment Function is used to determine the optimal level of investment for a given set of expected returns. It is also used to determine the optimal level of risk associated with a given investment. The Investment Function is based on the idea that the expected return on an investment is a function of the amount of capital invested, the expected rate of return, and the risk associated with the investment. The Investment Function is used to evaluate the potential profitability of an investment and to determine the optimal level of investment for a given set of expected returns.","The investment function is a concept in economics that refers to the relationship between the level of investment in an economy and the factors that influence it. Investment is a crucial component of economic growth, as it is the means by which businesses and individuals acquire the capital necessary to expand their operations and create new jobs. The investment function is typically studied in the context of macroeconomics, which is concerned with the overall performance of the economy.

The investment function is influenced by a variety of factors, including interest rates, government policies, and the overall level of economic activity. For example, when interest rates are low, businesses and individuals are more likely to borrow money to invest in new projects, as the cost of borrowing is lower. Similarly, government policies that encourage investment, such as tax incentives or subsidies, can also have a significant impact on the investment function.

Understanding the investment function is important for policymakers, as it can help them to design policies that promote economic growth and stability. By analyzing the factors that influence investment, economists can develop models that predict how changes in these factors will affect the overall level of investment in the economy. This information can then be used to inform policy decisions and promote economic growth.",0

The campaign was criticised by the Scottish National Party (SNP) and other pro-independence campaigners, who argued that the campaign was scaremongering and that independence would bring economic and social benefits to Scotland. The SNP also argued that the campaign was funded by the UK government, and that it was biased in favour of the pro-union parties.

The Better Together campaign was ultimately unsuccessful, with the majority of Scots voting in favour of independence in the 2014 referendum. However, the campaign was credited with mobilising a large number of voters, and with helping to ensure that the referendum was a fair and democratic process.","Better Together was a campaign launched in 2012 by the United Kingdom government and various political parties in Scotland to oppose the Scottish independence referendum. The referendum, held on September 18, 2014, asked Scottish voters whether they wanted Scotland to become an independent country or remain part of the United Kingdom. The Better Together campaign argued that Scotland was better off economically, socially, and politically as part of the UK. 

The campaign was led by Alistair Darling, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and included representatives from the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, and the Liberal Democrats. It was supported by prominent figures such as Gordon Brown, the former Prime Minister of the UK, and J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series. 

The Better Together campaign faced strong opposition from the Yes Scotland campaign, which argued that Scotland would be better off as an independent country. The campaign was marked by intense debate and campaigning, with both sides making their case to the Scottish electorate. In the end, the Better Together campaign prevailed, with 55.3% of Scottish voters choosing to remain part of the UK.",0

Nitrosomonas is a genus of Gram-negative, chemoautotrophic, rod-shaped bacteria. They are obligate aerobes and are found in aquatic environments, including soil, sewage, and freshwater. Nitrosomonas are important in the nitrogen cycle, as they are responsible for the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite. They are also used in wastewater treatment processes, as they are capable of converting ammonia to nitrate. Nitrosomonas are also known to produce nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas.

Nitrosomonas are chemoautotrophic, meaning they obtain their energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds. They are able to oxidize ammonia to nitrite, using the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase. This process is the first step in the nitrification process, which is essential for the cycling of nitrogen in the environment. Nitrosomonas are also capable of oxidizing other compounds, such as nitrite, nitrate, and nitrous oxide.

Nitrosomonas are found in a variety of aquatic environments, including soil, sewage, and freshwater. They are typically found in high concentrations in areas with high levels of ammonia, such as wastewater treatment plants. Nitrosomonas are also found in the rhizosphere, the area around the roots of plants, where they are important for the cycling of nitrogen.

Zhelestidae,"

Zhelestidae is an extinct family of mammal-like reptiles that lived during the Late Permian period, approximately 260 million years ago. The family was first described in 1972 by Soviet paleontologist Alexander Ochev, and is currently represented by two genera: Zhelestes and Parazhelestes. Zhelestidae is one of the most primitive groups of therapsids, a group of reptiles that are closely related to mammals.

Zhelestidae is characterized by a number of unique features, including a long, narrow snout and a large, rounded head. The skull is also relatively short compared to other therapsids, and the teeth are small and conical. The body is relatively small, with a long tail and four short legs. The limbs are adapted for running, and the feet are equipped with five digits.

The diet of Zhelestidae is unknown, but it is likely that they were insectivores, feeding on small invertebrates such as insects and spiders. They may also have been omnivorous, consuming both plant and animal matter.

Zhelestidae is an important group of therapsids, as they are the earliest known members of the group. They provide valuable insight into the evolution of therapsids, and are a key link between the more primitive pelycosaurs and the more advanced therapsids. As such, they are an important part of the fossil record.","Zhelestidae is a family of extinct mammals that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 70 to 66 million years ago. They are known from fossils found in Asia, particularly in Mongolia and China. The family is named after the Zheleznovodsk Formation in Russia, where the first fossils were discovered.

Zhelestids were small to medium-sized mammals, with some species reaching up to the size of a modern-day raccoon. They had a diverse range of dental adaptations, indicating that they had a varied diet. Some species had sharp, carnivorous teeth, while others had flat molars for grinding plant material.

The family is divided into two subfamilies: Zhelestinae and Gobiconodontinae. Zhelestinae includes the genera Zhelestes and Asioryctes, while Gobiconodontinae includes Gobiconodon and Jugulator. Zhelestids are believed to be closely related to multituberculates, a group of extinct mammals that were abundant during the Mesozoic era.

Human Development Index,"

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a statistic composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development. The index was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and Indian economist Amartya Sen in 1990 and has been used by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) since 1993. The HDI is a measure of the average achievements in a country in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions. The HDI is used to measure and compare the level of human development among countries, and is used as a benchmark for policy-making in international development. The HDI is based on the following indicators: life expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling, expected years of schooling, and gross national income per capita. The HDI is calculated annually by the UNDP and is widely used as an indicator of a country's development status.","The Human Development Index (HDI) is a statistical tool used to measure a country's overall level of human development. It was developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1990 and has since become a widely used measure of human development across the world. The HDI is based on three key dimensions of human development: health, education, and income. These dimensions are measured using indicators such as life expectancy, years of schooling, and gross national income per capita. 

The HDI is designed to provide a more comprehensive picture of human development than traditional measures of economic growth, such as gross domestic product (GDP). It recognizes that economic growth alone does not necessarily lead to improvements in human well-being and that other factors, such as access to healthcare and education, are also important. 

The HDI is calculated for each country on an annual basis and is used to rank countries in terms of their level of human development. Countries with higher HDI scores are generally considered to have a higher level of human development and a better quality of life for their citizens. The HDI has been used to track progress towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to improve human well-being and reduce poverty and inequality around the world.",0

421-a tax exemption,"

The 421-a Tax Exemption is a real estate tax exemption program in New York City that was created in 1971 to encourage the construction of new housing. The program provides a partial exemption from real estate taxes for certain residential properties for a period of up to 25 years. The program is administered by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and is available to developers of new residential buildings, as well as to owners of existing buildings who make improvements or conversions.

The program is designed to encourage the construction of new housing and the rehabilitation of existing housing in New York City. The program provides a partial exemption from real estate taxes for certain residential properties for a period of up to 25 years. The exemption is based on the value of the improvements made to the property, and the amount of the exemption varies depending on the type of property and the location. The exemption is available to both new construction and existing buildings that are improved or converted to residential use.

The program has been controversial due to its cost to the city and its potential to distort the housing market. In 2015, the program was revised to provide more targeted benefits to low- and moderate-income households. The revised program requires developers to set aside a certain percentage of units for affordable housing in order to qualify for the tax exemption. The program has been credited with helping to create thousands of new housing units in New York City, but it has also been criticized for providing tax breaks to developers who would have built housing anyway.","The 421-a tax exemption is a program in New York City that provides tax incentives to developers who build new residential buildings. The program was first introduced in 1971 and has undergone several changes since then. The main goal of the program is to encourage the construction of new housing units in areas where there is a shortage of affordable housing.

Under the 421-a program, developers are eligible for tax exemptions for up to 25 years. The amount of the exemption depends on the location of the building and the type of housing being built. In general, the program provides more generous tax breaks for buildings in areas with high land values and for buildings that include a certain percentage of affordable housing units.

The 421-a program has been controversial in recent years, with critics arguing that it has not done enough to create affordable housing and that it has been overly generous to developers. In response to these criticisms, the program was revised in 2016 to require developers to include more affordable housing units in their projects in order to qualify for the tax exemption.

Despite these changes, the future of the 421-a program remains uncertain. Some advocates argue that the program is still necessary to encourage the construction of new housing units, while others believe that it should be replaced with more effective policies to address the city's affordable housing crisis.",0

Edsel,"

Edsel is an American automobile marque that was manufactured by Ford Motor Company from 1958 to 1960. The Edsel brand was created to fill a gap in the Ford lineup between the Ford and Mercury divisions. The Edsel was marketed as a premium automobile, but its failure to meet sales expectations led to its discontinuation after just three model years.

The Edsel was introduced on September 4, 1957, in a much-publicized launch. The Edsel was named after Edsel Ford, the son of Henry Ford, and was intended to compete with other mid-priced makes such as Oldsmobile, DeSoto, and Mercury. The Edsel was designed to bridge the gap between the Ford and Mercury divisions, and was marketed as a ""distinctive"" automobile.

The Edsel was available in a variety of body styles, including a two-door hardtop, four-door sedan, four-door station wagon, and a convertible. It was powered by a variety of engines, including a standard 292-cubic-inch V8 and an optional 361-cubic-inch V8. The Edsel was also available with a variety of options, including power steering, power brakes, power windows, and air conditioning.

Despite its initial hype, the Edsel failed to meet sales expectations. The Edsel was criticized for its styling, which was considered too conservative and unappealing. The Edsel also suffered from poor quality control, which led to numerous mechanical problems. The Edsel's failure to meet sales expectations led to its discontinuation after just three model years. The Edsel brand was discontinued in November 1960, and the last Edsel rolled off the assembly line in February 1961.","Edsel is a brand of automobile that was produced by the Ford Motor Company from 1958 to 1960. The Edsel was named after Edsel Ford, the son of Henry Ford and the president of Ford Motor Company at the time. The brand was created to fill a gap in the market between Ford and Mercury, but it was ultimately a commercial failure.

The Edsel was introduced with great fanfare in 1957, with a massive advertising campaign and a range of models that included sedans, convertibles, and station wagons. However, the car's unusual styling, which included a distinctive ""horse collar"" grille and ""teletouch"" push-button transmission, was not well-received by the public. The Edsel also suffered from quality control issues and was priced higher than comparable models from other manufacturers.

Despite efforts to improve the brand, including the introduction of new models and a redesign of the grille, sales continued to decline. In 1960, Ford made the decision to discontinue the Edsel, and the last models were produced in November of that year. Today, the Edsel is remembered as a cautionary tale of marketing and product development gone wrong, but it remains a fascinating piece of automotive history.",0

The Phone Message,"

The Phone Message is a short story written by American author Raymond Carver. It was first published in the December 1981 issue of Esquire magazine, and later included in Carver's 1983 collection, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. The story follows a man who receives a phone message from a woman he does not know, and his attempts to decipher its meaning.

The Phone Message is a classic example of Carver's minimalist style, with its sparse dialogue and lack of detailed description. The story is told from the point of view of the unnamed protagonist, who is left to ponder the meaning of the mysterious phone message. The story is set in an unnamed city, and the protagonist is a married man who is struggling to make sense of the message. He is left to wonder who the woman is, why she called, and what she wants from him.

The Phone Message is a story of ambiguity and uncertainty. The protagonist is left to grapple with the implications of the message, and the reader is left to draw their own conclusions. The story has been interpreted in various ways, with some critics suggesting that it is a commentary on the human condition, and our inability to truly understand one another. Others have suggested that the story is a metaphor for the power of communication, and how a single message can have a profound impact on our lives.","The Phone Message is a short film directed by John Lasseter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios. It was released in 1978 and is considered one of the earliest works of computer animation. The film tells the story of a man who receives a series of increasingly absurd phone messages from his girlfriend, who is trying to reach him while he is out. The messages become more and more ridiculous as the film progresses, culminating in a surreal and hilarious finale.

The Phone Message was created using a process called ""keyframe animation,"" which involved manually creating each frame of the film using a computer. This was a groundbreaking technique at the time, as most animation was still done by hand. The film was also notable for its use of humor and its innovative storytelling techniques.

Although The Phone Message was not widely seen upon its initial release, it has since become a cult classic and is considered an important milestone in the history of computer animation. It is often cited as an inspiration by other animators and filmmakers, and has been praised for its creativity, humor, and technical innovation.",0

Maximum segment size,"

Maximum Segment Size (MSS) is a parameter used in Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) communications to determine the largest amount of data that can be sent in a single segment. It is the size of the largest segment that a device can receive, specified in bytes. The MSS is typically set by the sender and is announced during the initial connection setup. The MSS is used to prevent the sender from sending too much data at once, which could cause network congestion. It is also used to ensure that the data is not fragmented when it is sent across multiple networks. The MSS is typically set to a value that is equal to the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the network minus the size of the TCP and IP headers. This ensures that the data is not fragmented when it is sent across multiple networks.","Maximum segment size (MSS) is a term used in computer networking that refers to the largest amount of data that can be transmitted in a single data segment. It is an important parameter in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that governs the transfer of data over the internet. The MSS is determined by the maximum size of the data field in the TCP header, which is typically set by the network administrator or the operating system.

The MSS is important because it affects the efficiency and reliability of data transmission. If the MSS is too small, it can result in a large number of data segments being transmitted, which can lead to increased network congestion and slower data transfer rates. On the other hand, if the MSS is too large, it can result in data fragmentation, which can cause delays and errors in data transmission.

To optimize data transmission, the MSS is typically set to a value that is equal to the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the network. This ensures that data segments are transmitted efficiently and reliably, without causing network congestion or data fragmentation. The MSS is an important parameter that network administrators and system administrators must consider when configuring TCP/IP networks.",0

Alpha shape,"

Alpha shapes are a family of geometric shapes used in computational geometry and geographic information systems (GIS). They are used to represent the shape of a set of points in a two-dimensional space. Alpha shapes are related to the concept of convex hulls, but are more flexible and can represent shapes that are not convex. Alpha shapes are defined by a single parameter, called the alpha value, which determines the shape of the resulting shape. Alpha shapes are used to represent the boundaries of clusters of points, such as the boundaries of a city or a lake. They can also be used to represent the boundaries of a region of interest, such as a watershed or a protected area. Alpha shapes are also used in the analysis of spatial data, such as in the analysis of spatial autocorrelation. Alpha shapes are also used in the visualization of spatial data, such as in the visualization of geographic information systems (GIS).","Alpha shape is a mathematical concept used in computational geometry to describe the shape of a set of points in space. It was first introduced by mathematician Herbert Edelsbrunner in 1983 as a way to generalize the concept of convex hulls to non-convex shapes. 

The alpha shape of a set of points is defined as the union of all the Delaunay triangulations of the points with edges longer than a certain threshold value, known as the alpha parameter. In other words, the alpha shape is a geometric object that captures the shape of a set of points by connecting them with triangles, but only including those triangles whose edges are shorter than the alpha parameter. 

Alpha shapes have a wide range of applications in various fields, including computer graphics, molecular modeling, and robotics. In computer graphics, alpha shapes are used to create smooth and visually appealing 3D models from point clouds. In molecular modeling, alpha shapes are used to study the shape and properties of molecules. In robotics, alpha shapes are used to plan the motion of robots in complex environments. 

Overall, alpha shape is a powerful mathematical tool that has found numerous applications in various fields, and continues to be an active area of research in computational geometry.",0

Acetate kinase,"

Acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible phosphorylation of acetate to acetyl phosphate. It is a member of the group of enzymes known as phosphotransferases, which transfer phosphate groups from high-energy donor molecules to other substrates. Acetate kinase is found in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. In bacteria, acetate kinase is involved in the metabolism of acetate, a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle. In eukaryotes, acetate kinase is involved in the metabolism of acetyl-CoA, a key intermediate in fatty acid metabolism. Acetate kinase is a homodimeric enzyme composed of two identical subunits. Each subunit contains a single active site, which is located at the interface between the two subunits. The active site contains a magnesium ion, which is essential for catalysis. Acetate kinase catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to acetate, forming acetyl phosphate and ADP. The reaction is reversible, and acetate kinase can also catalyze the reverse reaction, transferring a phosphate group from acetyl phosphate to ADP, forming acetate and ATP. Acetate kinase is an important enzyme in the metabolism of acetate and acetyl-CoA, and its activity is regulated by a variety of factors, including pH, temperature, and the concentration of its substrates.","Acetate kinase (AK) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of bacteria and archaea. It catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to acetate, producing acetyl phosphate and ADP. This reaction is important for the production of energy and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

AK is a member of the family of phosphotransferases, which are enzymes that transfer phosphate groups from one molecule to another. It is found in a wide range of bacterial and archaeal species, and is particularly important in anaerobic organisms that rely on fermentation for energy production.

The structure of AK has been extensively studied, and it is known to consist of two domains: a large N-terminal domain that contains the active site, and a smaller C-terminal domain that is involved in substrate binding. The enzyme is regulated by a variety of factors, including pH, temperature, and the availability of substrates and cofactors.

Acetate kinase has a number of important applications in biotechnology and bioremediation. It is used in the production of biofuels and other chemicals, and has been shown to be effective in the removal of pollutants from contaminated soils and water.",0

While Baroque art and architecture often featured grandiose and symmetrical designs, Cartilage Baroque was a more playful and whimsical style. It is often seen as a precursor to the Rococo movement, which emerged in France in the mid-18th century.","Cartilage Baroque is a term used to describe a style of art that emerged in the late 20th century. It is characterized by the use of organic materials, particularly animal bones and cartilage, as the primary medium for creating sculptures and other works of art. The term ""baroque"" is used to describe the ornate and highly decorative nature of the style, which often features intricate patterns and details.

Cartilage Baroque artists often draw inspiration from the natural world, incorporating elements of anatomy and biology into their work. Many of these artists also explore themes related to mortality and the fragility of life, using the delicate and ephemeral nature of cartilage and bone to convey these ideas.

One of the most notable practitioners of Cartilage Baroque is the artist and sculptor, Janine Antoni. Her work often incorporates her own body, using casts of her teeth and other body parts to create intricate and highly detailed sculptures.

Overall, Cartilage Baroque represents a unique and innovative approach to art, one that challenges traditional notions of beauty and aesthetics. Its use of unconventional materials and themes has helped to push the boundaries of contemporary art, inspiring new generations of artists to explore the possibilities of this exciting and dynamic style.",0

Nitro-Mannich reaction,"

The Nitro-Mannich reaction is an organic reaction in which an amine reacts with an aldehyde and a nitroalkane to form a Mannich base. The reaction is named after the German chemist Carl Mannich, who first reported it in 1912. The reaction is an important synthetic method for the preparation of amines and is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry.

The reaction involves the condensation of an aldehyde, an amine, and a nitroalkane in the presence of an acid catalyst. The reaction produces an α-amino nitroalkane, which is then converted into a Mannich base by the addition of a nucleophile such as an alcohol or an amine. The Mannich base can then be further reacted to form a variety of products, including amines, amides, and heterocycles.

The reaction is often used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, such as anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and anti-cancer agents. The reaction is also used in the synthesis of dyes, fragrances, and other industrial chemicals. The reaction is highly versatile and can be used to synthesize a wide range of compounds.

Solar road stud,"

A solar road stud, also known as a raised pavement marker, is a road safety device used to delineate road edges and centerlines. Solar road studs are designed to be highly visible and to reflect light from vehicle headlights. They are typically installed in locations where there is a risk of vehicles leaving the roadway, such as curves, intersections, and pedestrian crossings.

Solar road studs are powered by photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight into electricity. This electricity is then stored in a rechargeable battery, which powers the LED lights in the stud. The lights are designed to be highly visible, even in low light conditions. The studs are typically made from durable materials such as aluminum or stainless steel, and are designed to withstand the weight of vehicles.

Solar road studs are becoming increasingly popular due to their cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness. They require no external power source, and their energy consumption is minimal. Furthermore, they are easy to install and maintain, and can be used in a variety of locations.

Solar road studs are becoming increasingly popular in many countries, as they are seen as a cost-effective way to improve road safety.

These studs are typically made of durable materials such as aluminum, polycarbonate, or ceramic, and are designed to withstand heavy traffic and harsh weather conditions.

The solar road stud is equipped with a small solar panel that absorbs sunlight during the day and converts it into electrical energy, which is stored in a rechargeable battery. At night, the stored energy powers LED lights that are embedded in the stud, creating a bright and highly visible marker on the road surface.

Solar road studs are commonly used to mark lane boundaries, centerlines, and other important areas on the road, such as pedestrian crossings and roundabouts. They are also used to provide guidance and warning to drivers, such as indicating a change in road direction or alerting drivers to a potential hazard ahead.

Étienne Decroux,"

Étienne Decroux (1898-1991) was a French mime artist, actor, and teacher. He is best known for his development of corporeal mime, a form of physical theatre that emphasizes the use of the body as a means of expression. He was a major influence on the development of modern mime, and his work has been influential in the fields of theatre, dance, and physical theatre.

Decroux was born in Paris in 1898. He began his career as an actor, performing in a variety of plays and films. He was particularly interested in the physicality of acting, and began to explore the possibilities of using the body as a means of expression. In the 1930s, he began to develop his own form of physical theatre, which he called corporeal mime. This form of mime focused on the use of the body as a tool for expression, and emphasized the use of gesture, posture, and movement to convey meaning.

Decroux's work was highly influential in the development of modern mime. He taught his technique to a number of students, including Marcel Marceau, who went on to become one of the most famous mime artists of all time. Decroux's influence can also be seen in the work of other physical theatre practitioners, such as Jacques Lecoq and Philippe Gaulier.

Decroux continued to teach and perform until his death in 1991.

Plus-One system,"

The Plus-One system is a system of student assessment and evaluation used in many countries around the world. It is based on the idea that students should be assessed on their individual performance, rather than on the performance of their peers. The system is designed to provide a more accurate measure of a student's academic progress, as well as to provide a more equitable way of evaluating students.

The Plus-One system was first developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s and has since been adopted by many other countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. In the United Kingdom, the system is known as the A-level system, while in the United States it is known as the Advanced Placement (AP) system.

In the Plus-One system, students are assessed on their individual performance, rather than on the performance of their peers. This means that students are not judged against each other, but rather against a set of standards. Each student is given a score based on their performance, which is then compared to the scores of other students in the same grade. The highest score is given a grade of A, while the lowest score is given a grade of F.

The Plus-One system is designed to provide a more accurate measure of a student's academic progress, as well as to provide a more equitable way of evaluating students. It is also designed to encourage students to strive for excellence, as the higher grades are rewarded with higher marks. Additionally, the system allows for more individualized instruction, as teachers are able to focus on the areas where students need the most help.","The Plus-One system is a method of voting used in various parliamentary and legislative bodies around the world. It is also known as the ""single transferable vote"" system. The Plus-One system is designed to ensure that each vote counts, and that the results of an election accurately reflect the preferences of the voters.

Under the Plus-One system, voters rank candidates in order of preference. If a candidate receives more votes than the number needed to win, the excess votes are transferred to the next preferred candidate on each voter's ballot. This process continues until all seats are filled.

The Plus-One system is often used in multi-member districts, where voters elect several representatives at once. It is also used in some single-member districts, where it is intended to ensure that the winning candidate has broad support among the electorate.

Advocates of the Plus-One system argue that it promotes greater voter choice and encourages candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters. Critics, however, argue that it can be complex and difficult for voters to understand, and that it can lead to unpredictable results. Despite these criticisms, the Plus-One system remains a popular method of voting in many countries around the world.",0
Skin effect,"

The Skin Effect is a phenomenon in electrical engineering that describes the tendency of an alternating current (AC) to distribute itself within a conductor such that the current density is greatest near the surface of the conductor. This effect is due to the fact that the resistance of a conductor increases with increasing frequency, and thus the current is forced to flow closer to the surface of the conductor. The Skin Effect is most pronounced in conductors of large cross-sectional area, such as cables and wires. The Skin Effect is also known as the Proximity Effect, and is an important consideration in the design of electrical circuits.

The Skin Effect is caused by the fact that the electrical resistance of a conductor increases with frequency. This is due to the fact that the electrons in the conductor are affected by the alternating electric field, and thus move in a circular motion. This motion creates a magnetic field which opposes the alternating electric field, thus increasing the resistance of the conductor. The Skin Effect is most pronounced in conductors of large cross-sectional area, such as cables and wires.

The Skin Effect can be used to advantage in the design of electrical circuits. For example, in high-frequency circuits, the Skin Effect can be used to reduce the amount of current flowing through the conductor, thus reducing the amount of power dissipated in the conductor. In addition, the Skin Effect can be used to reduce the amount of interference caused by the conductor, as the current is confined to the surface of the conductor.

The Skin Effect is also important in the design of antennas, as the current is concentrated near the surface of the antenna, thus increasing the radiation efficiency. The Skin Effect is also important in the design of transformers, as the current is concentrated near the surface of the windings, thus reducing the amount of power lost in the windings.","Skin effect is a phenomenon that occurs in conductors carrying alternating current (AC). It is characterized by the tendency of the current to concentrate near the surface of the conductor, rather than being evenly distributed throughout its cross-section. This effect is caused by the interaction between the magnetic field generated by the current and the resistance of the conductor.

The skin effect becomes more pronounced as the frequency of the AC increases, and it can have a significant impact on the performance of electrical systems. In high-frequency applications, such as radio transmission and power distribution, the skin effect can cause significant power losses and reduce the efficiency of the system.

To mitigate the effects of the skin effect, engineers and designers use a variety of techniques, including increasing the size of the conductor, using multiple smaller conductors in parallel, and using conductors made of materials with higher conductivity. Additionally, the skin effect can be reduced by using special winding techniques in transformers and other electrical components.

Overall, the skin effect is an important consideration in the design and operation of electrical systems, and understanding its causes and effects is essential for ensuring optimal performance and efficiency.",0

Luminous efficiency function,"

The luminous efficiency function (LEF) is a measure of the efficiency of a light source in converting energy into visible light. It is defined as the ratio of the luminous flux emitted by a light source to the power it consumes. The LEF is an important factor in the design of lighting systems, as it determines the amount of light that can be produced for a given amount of energy. The LEF is typically expressed in lumens per watt (lm/W).

The LEF is determined by the spectral power distribution of the light source, which is the amount of light emitted at each wavelength. Different types of light sources have different spectral power distributions, and thus different LEFs. For example, incandescent bulbs have a relatively low LEF, while LED lights have a much higher LEF.

The LEF can also be affected by the environment in which the light source is used. For example, the LEF of a light source may be lower in a room with a high level of ambient light, as the light from the source may be overwhelmed by the existing light. Similarly, the LEF of a light source may be lower in a room with a high level of heat, as the heat may reduce the efficiency of the light source.

The LEF is an important factor in the design of lighting systems, as it determines the amount of light that can be produced for a given amount of energy. It is also important for assessing the environmental impact of lighting systems, as it can be used to compare the energy efficiency of different types of light sources.","The Luminous Efficiency Function (LEF) is a measure of the human eye's sensitivity to light of different wavelengths. It is used to calculate the perceived brightness of light sources and is an essential tool in the field of lighting design. The LEF is based on the spectral sensitivity of the human eye, which varies with wavelength. The LEF is typically represented as a graph, with wavelength on the x-axis and luminous efficiency on the y-axis. The LEF is used to calculate the luminous flux of a light source, which is the amount of light emitted by the source that is visible to the human eye. The LEF is also used to calculate the color rendering index (CRI) of a light source, which is a measure of how accurately the colors of objects are rendered under that light source. The LEF has been standardized by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) and is used in lighting design and research around the world.",0

Calcific tendinitis,"

Calcific tendinitis, also known as calcific tendonitis, is a condition characterized by the deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals in a tendon. It is most commonly seen in the rotator cuff tendons of the shoulder, but can also occur in other tendons such as the Achilles tendon, biceps tendon, and patellar tendon. The condition is most common in middle-aged adults, and is more common in women than men. Symptoms of calcific tendinitis include pain, swelling, and decreased range of motion in the affected area. Treatment typically involves non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and in some cases, corticosteroid injections. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the calcium deposits.

The exact cause of calcific tendinitis is unknown, but it is thought to be related to an imbalance in the body's calcium metabolism. It is also believed that the condition may be caused by an underlying inflammatory process, or by trauma to the tendon. Risk factors for calcific tendinitis include age, gender, and certain medical conditions such as diabetes and hypothyroidism. Diagnosis is typically made based on a physical examination and imaging studies such as X-rays or ultrasound.","Calcific tendinitis is a medical condition that affects the tendons, which are the fibrous tissues that connect muscles to bones.

Michel Micombero,"

Michel Micombero (1936-2015) was a Burundian politician and military leader who served as the first President of Burundi from 1966 to 1976. He was a member of the Tutsi ethnic group and was a major figure in the Hutu-Tutsi conflict that has plagued Burundi since independence.

Micombero was born in 1936 in the province of Rutana in Burundi. He was educated at the University of Louvain in Belgium, where he studied law and economics. Upon his return to Burundi, he joined the Union for National Progress (UPRONA) party, which was led by Prince Louis Rwagasore. In 1965, he was appointed Minister of Justice and Interior in the government of Prime Minister Pierre Ngendandumwe.

In 1966, following the assassination of Rwagasore, Micombero was chosen to succeed him as President of Burundi. He was the first Tutsi to hold the office since independence in 1962. During his tenure, he implemented a number of policies aimed at strengthening the Tutsi-dominated government. These included the introduction of a one-party state, the banning of opposition parties, and the introduction of a new constitution which granted the president sweeping powers.

Micombero's rule was marked by a series of human rights abuses, including the imprisonment and torture of political opponents. In 1972, he declared a state of emergency and imposed martial law. This led to a period of civil unrest and violence, culminating in a failed coup attempt in 1976. Following the coup, Micombero was deposed and replaced by Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza.

Micombero died in 2015 at the age of 79. He is remembered as a controversial figure in Burundian history, and his legacy remains a source of debate.","Michel Micombero was a Burundian military officer and politician who served as the President of Burundi from 1966 to 1976. Born on October 26, 1940, in Rutovu, Bururi Province, Micombero was educated at the École des Sous-Officiers in Kigali, Rwanda, and later at the École Militaire Interarmes in Saint-Cyr, France.

Micombero rose to power in Burundi following a military coup in 1966 that overthrew the country's first elected president, Prince Louis Rwagasore. As the leader of the coup, Micombero became the country's second president and ruled with an iron fist, suppressing political opposition and dissent.

During his tenure, Micombero implemented policies that favored the Hutu ethnic group over the Tutsi, which led to increased tensions and violence between the two groups. In 1972, he launched a brutal campaign against the Hutu population, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 100,000 people.

Micombero's regime was also marked by economic stagnation and corruption, which further fueled public discontent. In 1976, he was overthrown in a military coup led by Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, and he fled to exile in Switzerland, where he lived until his death in 1983. Despite his controversial legacy, Micombero remains a significant figure in Burundi's history, and his rule continues to shape the country's political and social landscape.",0

Genghis Khan,"

Genghis Khan (c. 1162 – August 18, 1227) was the founder and first Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous empire in history after his death. He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. After founding the Mongol Empire and being proclaimed ""Genghis Khan"", he launched the Mongol invasions that conquered most of Eurasia. These campaigns were often accompanied by large-scale massacres of the civilian populations – especially in the Khwarezmian controlled lands. By the end of his life, the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China.

Genghis Khan was a warrior and ruler of genius who, starting from obscure and insignificant beginnings, brought all the nomadic tribes of Mongolia under the rule of himself and his family in a rigidly disciplined military state. He then turned his attention to the settled peoples of the Middle East and China, conquering them and establishing the largest contiguous empire in the world.

Genghis Khan was a brilliant military strategist and tactician, and his armies were feared throughout Eurasia. He was also a great statesman, and his laws and administrative system were adopted by many of the conquered peoples. He was a patron of the arts and sciences, and his empire was a major center of trade and commerce.

Genghis Khan was a ruthless leader who was known for his brutality and cruelty. He was also a great leader who was able to unite the nomadic tribes of Mongolia and create a powerful empire. His legacy is still felt today in the form of the Mongol Empire, which was the largest contiguous empire in history.","Genghis Khan, also known as Temüjin, was the founder and first emperor of the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous empire in world history. Born in 1162 in the region that is now Mongolia, Genghis Khan grew up in a nomadic tribe and experienced a difficult childhood marked by violence and poverty. He rose to power through a combination of military prowess, political cunning, and strategic alliances, and by the time of his death in 1227, he had conquered vast territories across Asia and Eastern Europe.

It is located in the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River. Its surface and shores are 423 metres (1,388 ft) below sea level, Earth's lowest elevation on land. The Dead Sea is 377 m (1,237 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2%, it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water.

The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts, and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilizers. People also use the salt and the minerals from the Dead Sea to create cosmetics and herbal sachets.

The Dead Sea is receding at an alarming rate. Multiple canals and pipelines were proposed to reduce its recession, which had begun causing many problems. The Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, carried out by Jordan, will provide water to neighboring countries, while the brine will be carried to the Dead Sea to help stabilize its water level.

The Dead Sea has become a major center for health research and treatment for several reasons. The mineral content of the water, the very low content of pollens and other allergens in the atmosphere, the reduced ultraviolet component of solar radiation, and the higher atmospheric pressure at this great depth each have specific health effects.","The Dead Sea is a saltwater lake located in the Jordan Rift Valley, bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and Palestine to the west. It is the lowest point on Earth, with its surface and shores lying 430.5 meters (1,412 feet) below sea level. The Dead Sea is known for its high salt concentration, which is about 10 times higher than that of the ocean, making it one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world.

The Dead Sea is also famous for its therapeutic properties, due to the high concentration of minerals such as magnesium, calcium, and potassium. People have been visiting the Dead Sea for centuries to benefit from its healing properties, and it has become a popular destination for tourists seeking relaxation and rejuvenation.

Despite its name, the Dead Sea is not actually a sea, but rather a lake. Its name comes from the fact that no fish or other marine life can survive in its waters due to the high salt concentration. However, the Dead Sea is home to unique forms of bacteria and algae that have adapted to its extreme conditions.

The Dead Sea is also a site of historical and cultural significance, with numerous biblical and archaeological sites located in the surrounding area. It is a popular destination for tourists, with many hotels, spas, and resorts offering a range of activities and treatments.",0

Orchids,"

Orchids are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with blooms that are often colourful and fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family. With over 25,000 species, it is one of the largest families of flowering plants. Orchids are distributed all over the world, from the tropics to the polar regions, and can be found in almost every habitat. They can be found in deserts, rainforests, grasslands, and even in the most unlikely places, such as on the surface of rocks and in the crevices of tree bark.

Orchids are perennial herbs, and most species have two distinct growth forms: terrestrial and epiphytic. Terrestrial orchids grow in the soil, while epiphytic orchids grow on the surface of other plants or trees. The flowers of orchids are usually showy and often fragrant, and the plants are often grown as ornamental plants. The leaves of orchids are usually thin and leathery, and the roots are often thick and fleshy.

Orchids are pollinated by a variety of insects, birds, and other animals. The flowers of orchids are often adapted to attract specific pollinators, and the pollinators are often adapted to feed on the flowers. Orchids are also known for their ability to reproduce asexually, through a process known as vegetative reproduction.

Orchids have been cultivated for centuries, and they are now grown in many parts of the world. They are popular as houseplants, and they are also used in the perfume and food industries. Orchids are also used in traditional medicine, and some species are used in the production of pharmaceuticals.","Orchids are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with over 28,000 species and more than 100,000 hybrids and cultivars.

Orchids have been cultivated for thousands of years, prized for their ornamental value and medicinal properties.

The flowers of orchids are often highly specialized, with complex shapes and colors that attract specific pollinators. Some orchids have evolved to mimic the appearance and scent of female insects, tricking males into attempting to mate with them and inadvertently pollinating the flower. Others have developed long nectar spurs or other structures that require specific pollinators to reach the reward.

Orchids have a long and fascinating history, with many species playing important roles in traditional medicine and cultural practices. Today, they are widely cultivated for their beauty and are a popular subject for collectors and hobbyists. Despite their popularity, many orchid species are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection, and conservation efforts are underway to protect these valuable plants.",0

Snuff (tobacco),"

Snuff is a smokeless tobacco product that is made from ground or pulverized tobacco leaves. It is inhaled or ""snuffed"" into the nose, where it is absorbed through the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity. Snuff has been used since ancient times, and was popular in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is still used in some parts of the world today, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia.

Snuff is available in a variety of forms, including dry, moist, and scented varieties. Dry snuff is usually sold as a powder, while moist snuff is usually sold in tins or pouches. Scented snuff is flavored with ingredients such as menthol, spices, and floral essences.

Snuff is usually taken by placing a pinch of the powder between the lower lip and gum, or by sniffing it into the nose. It can also be taken orally, by placing a pinch of the powder on the tongue and swallowing it. The effects of snuff are similar to those of smoking tobacco, but without the smoke. It can cause a mild buzz, and can also lead to addiction.

Snuff has been linked to a variety of health risks, including cancer, heart disease, and stroke. It can also cause irritation to the nasal passages and throat, and can lead to gum disease. For these reasons, snuff is not recommended for use by children or pregnant women.","Snuff is a type of finely ground tobacco that is inhaled through the nose. It has been used for centuries and was particularly popular in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe and North America. Snuff is made by grinding tobacco leaves into a fine powder and then flavoring it with various ingredients such as menthol, spices, or fruit extracts. 

Snuff is typically taken by placing a small amount on the back of the hand or a special snuff spoon and then sniffing it into the nostrils. It can produce a strong and immediate nicotine rush and is often used as a substitute for smoking or chewing tobacco. 

While snuff is less harmful than smoking, it is not without risks. It can cause irritation and damage to the nasal passages and has been linked to an increased risk of nasal cancer. Additionally, snuff can be addictive and may lead to dependence on nicotine.

Iron Age,"

The Iron Age is a period in human history that followed the Bronze Age and preceded the transition to the Early Middle Ages. It is commonly considered to have begun in the 12th century BC in the Near East, and to have ended in the 6th century AD with the beginning of the Medieval period in Europe. The Iron Age is the last principal period of the three-age system, preceded by the Stone Age and the Bronze Age.

The Iron Age is characterized by the widespread use of iron or steel. The use of iron or steel marked the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age. Iron working was introduced to Europe in the late 11th century BC, probably from the Caucasus, and slowly spread northwards and westwards over the succeeding 500 years.

During the Iron Age, the best tools and weapons were made from steel, particularly alloys which were produced with a carbon content between approximately 0.30% and 1.2%. Steel weapons and tools were far superior to bronze weapons and tools. Steel was increasingly used for agriculture, and new tools such as the plough and the sickle were developed.

The Iron Age in Europe is characterized by an elaboration of designs in weapons, implements, and utensils. These are no longer cast but hammered into shape. The introduction of the first smelting techniques in the 11th century BC allowed the mass production of tools and weapons of much higher quality than previously possible.

The Iron Age in Europe saw a gradual rise in population. This was probably due to improved agricultural practices, such as the use of the plough and the introduction of crop rotation. This allowed for the production of larger surpluses, which in turn supported a more dense population. The Iron Age also saw the development of trade networks and economic systems.

The Iron Age in Europe is generally divided into the early Iron Age, the middle Iron Age, and the late Iron Age. The early Iron Age is characterized by the widespread use of iron, but also by the use of bronze. The middle Iron Age saw the development of the Hallstatt culture, which flourished in much of Central Europe, and the La Tène culture, which flourished in much of North-Western Europe. The late Iron Age saw the emergence of the Roman Empire and the beginnings of written history.","The Iron Age is a period in human history that spans from approximately 1200 BCE to 500 BCE. It is characterized by the widespread use of iron tools and weapons, which replaced the earlier bronze age technology. The Iron Age is often divided into three distinct periods: the early Iron Age, the middle Iron Age, and the late Iron Age.

During the early Iron Age, iron technology was still relatively new and was used primarily for tools and weapons. The middle Iron Age saw the rise of powerful empires, such as the Assyrian and Persian empires, which used iron weapons to conquer and control vast territories. The late Iron Age saw the emergence of new cultures and civilizations, such as the Celts in Europe and the Zhou dynasty in China.

The Iron Age also saw significant advancements in agriculture, with the introduction of iron plows and other tools that made farming more efficient. This led to increased food production and population growth, which in turn fueled the growth of cities and civilizations.

Overall, the Iron Age was a period of significant technological, social, and cultural change, and it laid the foundation for many of the developments that would shape human history in the centuries to come.",0
Jean Japart,"

He was born in Paris, France and studied at the École des Beaux-Arts. His early works were heavily influenced by Impressionism, but he later developed a more abstract style. He was a member of the Section d'Or, a group of artists who sought to create a new form of art that combined Cubism, Futurism, and Orphism.

Japart's work was often characterized by its bold colors and geometric forms. He was particularly interested in the relationship between color and form, and he often used bright colors to create a sense of movement and energy. He was also interested in the relationship between the human figure and the environment, and he often used figures to create a sense of harmony between the two.

Japart's work was exhibited widely in Europe and the United States, and he was a frequent participant in the Salon des Indépendants. He was also a member of the Abstraction-Création group, which sought to promote abstract art. He was also a founding member of the Association des Artistes Indépendants, which sought to promote the work of independent artists.

Ablation zone,"

Ablation zone is a term used to describe a region of a glacier or ice sheet where the rate of ice loss is greater than the rate of accumulation. This is typically due to melting or calving of the glacier or ice sheet, which results in a net loss of ice mass. Ablation zones are typically found at the terminus of a glacier or ice sheet, where the ice is exposed to warmer temperatures and is more prone to melting. The ablation zone is also known as the zone of wastage, as it is where the glacier or ice sheet is wasting away.

Ablation zones are important to study, as they are a key indicator of climate change and glacial retreat. As the climate warms, the ablation zone of a glacier or ice sheet will expand, resulting in a net loss of ice mass. This can have a significant impact on the local environment, as the loss of ice can lead to changes in the local hydrology and ecology.

Ablation zones can also be used to study the dynamics of a glacier or ice sheet. By studying the rate of ablation in a particular region, scientists can gain insight into the dynamics of the glacier or ice sheet, such as the rate of flow and the rate of calving. This information can be used to better understand the behavior of the glacier or ice sheet and to make predictions about its future behavior.

Ablation zones are also important for the study of glacial geology. By studying the ablation zone of a glacier or ice sheet, scientists can gain insight into the history of the glacier or ice sheet, such as when it was last active and when it began to retreat. This information can be used to better understand the evolution of the glacier or ice sheet and to make predictions about its future behavior.","The ablation zone, also known as the zone of wastage, is a region of a glacier where the ice is melting faster than it is being replenished by snowfall. This zone is located at the lower end of the glacier and is characterized by a steep gradient and a rough, uneven surface. The ablation zone is an important component of the glacier system, as it is responsible for the loss of ice mass and the contribution of meltwater to downstream rivers and lakes.

The ablation zone is affected by a number of factors, including temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. In general, warmer temperatures and increased solar radiation lead to greater melting, while increased precipitation can help to offset this effect by replenishing the glacier with fresh snow. However, in recent years, many glaciers around the world have experienced significant melting due to rising global temperatures, leading to concerns about the long-term viability of these important natural resources.

Despite the challenges posed by climate change, the ablation zone remains an important area of study for glaciologists and other scientists. By understanding the processes that drive melting in this region, researchers can gain insights into the broader dynamics of the glacier system and develop strategies for mitigating the impacts of climate change on these vital ecosystems.",0

He was born in the late 8th century and was a member of the nobility in the region of Westphalia, which was then part of the Saxon territory. Widukind was a fierce opponent of Charlemagne, the Frankish king who sought to expand his empire into Saxon lands. 

Widukind led several rebellions against Charlemagne, including the famous Saxon Wars, which lasted from 772 to 804. During this time, Widukind and his fellow Saxons fought fiercely against the Frankish army, using guerrilla tactics and their knowledge of the terrain to their advantage. Despite several defeats, Widukind continued to resist Charlemagne's attempts to subjugate the Saxons, and his leadership inspired many others to join the cause. 

Widukind's resistance ultimately proved unsuccessful, and he was forced to surrender to Charlemagne in 785.

Earthquake shaking table,"

An earthquake shaking table, also known as a seismic simulator, is a device used to simulate the effects of an earthquake on a structure. It is used to test the seismic performance of structures, such as buildings, bridges, and dams, and to determine their resistance to seismic activity. The shaking table is typically a large, rectangular steel table that is mounted on hydraulic or electromechanical actuators. The table is driven by a computer-controlled system that applies a series of simulated seismic waves to the structure. The shaking table can be used to test the seismic performance of a structure in a laboratory setting, or it can be used in the field to test the performance of a structure during an actual earthquake. The shaking table is an important tool for engineers and architects, as it allows them to design structures that are better able to withstand the forces of an earthquake.","An earthquake shaking table is a device used to simulate the effects of an earthquake on structures and soil. It consists of a large table that can move in different directions and at different speeds, mimicking the motion of an earthquake. The table is typically made of steel and is supported by hydraulic or pneumatic actuators that can generate forces of up to several hundred tons.

Earthquake shaking tables are used in earthquake engineering research to study the behavior of structures and soil during earthquakes. They are also used in the design and testing of earthquake-resistant structures, such as buildings, bridges, and dams. By subjecting these structures to simulated earthquakes, engineers can evaluate their performance and identify potential weaknesses.

The first earthquake shaking table was built in Japan in the early 20th century. Since then, shaking tables have become an essential tool in earthquake engineering research, with many universities and research institutions around the world having their own shaking tables. The largest shaking table in the world is located at the Earthquake Engineering Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, and can simulate earthquakes of up to magnitude 8.0.",0

Mixed-member proportional representation,"

Mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) is a voting system used in many countries around the world. It combines elements of proportional representation (PR) and single-member districts (SMD). In MMP, voters cast two votes: one for a local representative in their single-member district, and one for a political party. Seats in the legislature are then allocated to both the local representatives and the political parties, in proportion to the votes they receive.

MMP is designed to ensure that the overall composition of the legislature reflects the popular vote. This is achieved by compensating for any disproportionality in the local district results. For example, if a party receives more votes than seats in the local districts, it will be compensated with additional seats from the party list. This ensures that the overall composition of the legislature reflects the popular vote.

MMP has been used in countries such as Germany, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales. It is seen as a way to ensure that all political parties are represented in the legislature, and to give smaller parties a chance to gain seats. Supporters of MMP argue that it is a more democratic system than other voting systems, as it allows for a greater diversity of voices in the legislature. Critics argue that it is too complicated and can lead to confusion among voters.","Mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) is a voting system used in many countries around the world. It is a hybrid system that combines elements of both proportional representation and first-past-the-post voting. In MMP, voters cast two votes: one for a local representative in their constituency, and one for a political party. The number of seats a party receives in parliament is determined by the proportion of votes they receive nationwide, as well as the number of local representatives they win.

MMP is designed to ensure that the number of seats a party receives in parliament is proportional to the number of votes they receive. This helps to ensure that smaller parties are represented in parliament, and that the government reflects the diversity of political views in the country. MMP also ensures that voters have a local representative who is accountable to them, while still allowing for a proportional distribution of seats.

MMP is used in countries such as Germany, New Zealand, and Scotland, and has been praised for its ability to produce stable governments while still allowing for a diversity of political views. However, it has also been criticized for being complex and difficult for voters to understand, as well as for potentially leading to a proliferation of small parties. Despite these criticisms, MMP remains a popular voting system in many countries around the world.",0
